### 2. Cryptocurrency Tracking
The program fetches data from popular cryptocurrency exchanges, retrieves live prices, historical trends, and social media sentiment analysis to help users make informed decisions regarding cryptocurrency trading or investment.

### 3. Product Price Comparison
The program scrapes e-commerce platforms and price comparison websites to extract information about product prices, reviews, and ratings. It analyzes this data to identify the best deals and suggests opportunities for users to buy low and sell high.

### 4. Job Market Analysis
The program scrapes job posting websites, such as LinkedIn or Indeed, to collect information on job vacancies, skills in demand, and salary ranges for specific industries or job roles. It provides users with insights and recommendations to optimize their career growth and income potential.

### 5. News Sentiment Analysis
The program scrapes news websites and performs sentiment analysis on news articles related to specific industries or companies. It summarizes the overall sentiment and alerts users to any significant positive or negative developments that might impact stock prices or investment decisions.

news_scraper = NewsScraper()
social_media_monitor = SocialMediaMonitor()

stock_price, stock_volume, stock_sentiments = stock_scraper.get_real_time_stock_data("AAPL")
crypto_live_price, crypto_historical_trends, crypto_sentiments = crypto_scraper.fetch_cryptocurrency_data("BTC")
best_deals = product_scraper.scrape_product_price("laptop")
insights = job_market_scraper.scrape_job_market("data scientist")
overall_sentiment = news_scraper.sentiment_analysis_on_news("technology")
market_insights = social_media_monitor.social_media_monitoring("fashion")
```

Note that the code provided above is just an example, and you may need to modify it based on your specific requirements and the websites or APIs you choose to scrape.
